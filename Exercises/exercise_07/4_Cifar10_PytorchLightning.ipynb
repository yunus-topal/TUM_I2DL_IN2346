    "\n",
    "Do you remember the good old times when we used to implement everything in plain numpy? Luckily, these times are over and we're using PyTorch Lightning which makes everything MUCH easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of implementing your own model, solver and dataloader, all you have to do is defining a `LightningModule`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 0. Dataset & Dataloaders\n",
    "Check out the function `prepare_data` of the `CIFAR10DataModule` class that loads the dataset, using the class `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` (or the previous `MemoryImageFolder` dataset from exercise 3), which is very similar to the class `ImageFolderDataset` that you implemented earlier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a **transform** to pre-process the raw data (standardize it and convert it to tensors) and assign it to the variable `my_transform`. Note: On the submission server, the normalization as in the notebook 3 on data augmentation will be performed, so please make sure to use the same normalization! For convenience, we added the precomputed normalization values for you. All normalization you are defining here are tailored to your training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pytorch-lightning we could also include the dataset and other classes in our model, but a more reasonable way is to define it outside since it usually is used across multiple projects. If you prefer the all-in-one solution, that is great as well, but here we put it separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to improve your performance, you can also perform extensive **data augmentation** here!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also check out the `DataLoader` class that is used to create  `train_dataloader` and `val_dataloader` and that is very similar to your previous implementation of the DataLoader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Define your model\n",
    "Next, let's define your model. Think about a good network architecture. You're completely free here and you can come up with any network you like! (\\*)\n",

    "Have a look at the documentation of `torch.nn` at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html to learn how to use use this module to build your network!\n",

    "To make your model customizable and support parameter search, don't use hardcoded hyperparameters - instead, pass them as dictionary `hparams` (here, `n_hidden` is the number of neurons in the hidden layer) when initializing `MyPytorchModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an easy example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "        self.model = nn.Sequential(\n",

    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the forward path in `forward(self, x)`, which is so easy, that you don't need to implement it yourself. As PyTorch automatically computes the gradients, that's all we need to do! No need anymore to manually calculate derivatives for the backward paths! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "\\* *The size of your final model must be less than 20 MB, which is approximately equivalent to 5 Mio. params. Note that this limit is quite lenient, you will probably need much less parameters!*\n",

A pytorch-lightning model unifies training etc. but it inherently works like a pytorch model when you use `model.forward(blabla)`. For exercise 7 as well as 9-11 you can submit any pytorch model you so desire. In this notebook, we gave you the shell using a pytorch-lightning model since it simplifies everything (i.e., for both you and us on both the code purity as well as the datasets (and, thus, transforms etc.) being part of the model) and you can focus on the notation for now. What you will use later is your own decision and if you prefer to submit pure pytorch code that is cool too! As an exercise for eager people: after submittag and tuning a pytorch-lightning model with the current code, try to submit a pure pytorch version of said code to see what advantages pytorch lightning brings and where you feel you have more control. Good luck!\n",
